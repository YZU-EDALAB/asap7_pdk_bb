# Modified ASAP7 PDK with BPR and BSM Technologies

1. This PDK, here called ASAP7-BB PDK, is adapted from ASAP7 PDK release r1p5 (for r1p7 please see https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/asap7). The modified PDK have carried out following modification:
   - Implement single diffusion break.
   - Implement fin depopulation by increase fin height from 32nm to 49nm.
   - Implement contact over active gate technology.
   - Implement buried power rail (BPR) and backside metal technology.
2.	ASAP7-BB PDK also includes a 6-track standard cell library (BPR6L) whose cells each include a BPR respectively at the top and bottom edges of the cell.
3.	Original ASAP7 PDK was designed for working in Cadence place&route platform. Here we translate the DRC rules and technology LEF files from Cadence Innovus environment to Synopsys ICC2 environment to facilitate implement BPR and backside metal technologies. Hence, the user of ASAP7-BB PDK should notice that a couple of DRC rules are not completely translated.
